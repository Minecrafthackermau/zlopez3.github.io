00:00.4 --> 00:03.3
- When organizations have 
- a digital problem, they go

2
00:03.3 --> 00:05.2
- straight to hiring a 
- software company and they

3
00:05.3 --> 00:07.6
- don't realize they're not 
- getting everything they need.

4
00:07.9 --> 00:10.5
- Digital transformation, 
- software development,

5
00:10.6--> 00:012.8
- apps, web, apps, platforms.

6
00:12.9 --> 00:15.1
- We've lost focus on the human and

7
00:15.1 --> 00:17.0
- beings that have to use 
- this software.

8
00:19.9 --> 00:22.6
- When most companies hire an 
- agency, they usually end

9
00:22.6 --> 00:25.2
- up with a collection of 
- features based on assumptions.

10
00:26.1 --> 00:27.5
- This isn't innovation.

11
00:29.5 --> 00:31.8
- Making products that truly 
- solve problems

12
00:31.8 --> 00:33.4
- for your teams and your customers

13
00:33.7 --> 00:36.1
- requires more than just an engineer.

14
00:36.5 --> 00:38.9
- It requires somebody that's 
- going to design your

15
00:38.9 --> 00:40.8
- business model, work with 
- you on strategy.

16
00:40.8 --> 00:43.1
- It requires a team of 
- researchers and

17
00:43.2 --> 00:45.4
- designers to make a 
- seamless experience.

18
00:45.7 --> 00:48.6
- And of course, it requires 
- an amazing technical team

19
00:48.7 --> 00:51.1
- that can build things that 
- are secure and work.

20
00:51.5 --> 00:54.0
- We want to clearly understand 
- your big picture, so

21
00:54.0 --> 00:56.5
- when you tell us your 
- problems, we listen.

22
00:56.9 --> 00:59.0
- This means treating you 
- with the exact same open

23
00:59.0 --> 01:01.6
- mindedness and curiosity 
- as we treat your customers.

24
01:02.1 --> 01:05.2
- Creating tools and digital 
- products that people actually need

25
01:05.3 --> 01:08.7
- and love to use is a learned 
- skill, and

26
01:08.7 --> 01:10.8
- we've done it over and 
- over again.

27
01:11.0 --> 01:14.4
- We believe that small teams 
- can outperform teams

28
01:14.5 --> 01:17.6
- ten times their size because 
- of strong communication

29
01:17.7 --> 01:19.5
- and a high degree of collaboration.

30
01:19.6 --> 01:22.7
- We build products that fit 
- your strategic goals, nail

31
01:22.8 --> 01:26.4
- product market fit, and 
- drive habitual use the best

32
01:26.4 --> 01:29.2
- products in the world happen 
- when you've woven together

33
01:29.4 --> 01:33.4
- all these intricate details 
- and produce something that seems

34
01:33.4 --> 01:36.4
- so simple because it behaves 
- exactly the way you

35
01:36.4 --> 01:40.0
- expect it to exactly when 
- you expect it.

36
01:40.2 --> 01:43.2
- Making products that truly 
- solve problems and bring joy

37
01:43.2 --> 01:46.0
- to your customers is what's 
- most important to us.

38
01:46.4 --> 01:47.2
- The end.

39
01:47.3 --> 01:48.9
- It's something that makes 
- you step back and

40
01:48.9 --> 01:51.3
- say, how did we ever 
- function without this?

41
01:51.4 --> 01:52.8
- Getting that right matters.

42
01:52.9 --> 01:54.5
- And it matters to us, not just

43
01:54.6 --> 01:56.7
- temporarily, but for years to come.
